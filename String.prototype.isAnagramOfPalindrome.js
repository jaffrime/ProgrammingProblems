A string is a palindrome if it has exactly the same sequence of characters when read left-to-right as it has when read right-to-left. For example, the following strings are palindromes:

"kayak", "codilitytilidoc", "neveroddoreven". A string A is an anagram of a string B if A can be obtained from B by rearranging the characters. For example, in each of the following pairs one string is an anagram of the other:

"mary" and "army", "rocketboys" and "octobersky", "codility" and "codility". Write a function:

isAnagramOfPalindrome();

that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns true if S is an anagram of some palindrome and returns false otherwise.


This solution relies on the following facts:

A string is an anagram of a palindrome if and only if at most one character appears an odd number of times in it.

The specification stated that the input can only contain the 26 lowercase letters a â€“ z, which have consecutive codepoints in Unicode.

    var obj = {};
    var len = this.length;
    for (var i=0; i < len; i++) {
        console.log('hello');
        if (obj[this.charAt(i)]) {
            delete(obj[this.charAt(i)]);
        } else {
            obj[this.charAt(i)] = true;
        }
    }

    arr_obj = Object.keys(obj);

    return arr_obj.length === 1 || arr_obj.length === 0;
}
